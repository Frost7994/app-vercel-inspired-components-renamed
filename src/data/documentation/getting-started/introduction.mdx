## The Why

As my skills as a developer continuously grow, so does my github with projects from small to large. My base stack is **NextJS**, **TailwindCSS** and **Prisma** for full stack applications but each of these libraries require set up. Once each of these are configured the next step is creating some generic components and utilities such as `Layout`, `Button` or `mergeClasses`. After repeating these processes countless times I decided to put them all in one place in a docs style application, open sourced where I (and others) can copy the code from and use as necessary.

## The What

The libraries I tend to use most for building UI components are:

- HeadlessUI
- RadixUI
- TailwindCSS
- Framer-Motion
- Class-Variance-Authority
- clsx

**HeadlessUI** and **RadixUI** are both headless libraries that leave all the styling to the user.

**TailwindCSS** is my go to for styling apps since forever. I've tried multiple otehr libraries from MaterialUI to Chakra and find that TailwindCSS solves nearly all of my use cases in the simplest ways.

**Framer Motion** is an amazing library for animations which I integrate into most of the components I build in one way or another.

**CLass-Variance-Authority** and **Clsx** are two libraries I use together for the base styling of all my components.

## The How

Each of the components I build follow the same guidelines so that there is a simple pattern to follow. The components in this project follow a vercel-style theme but you can implement your own styles easily.

The **first step** is creating a utility called `mergeClasses`. It's a simple utility function that uses clsx and tailwind-merge to clean up styling in or components, the code is as follows:

```jsx
// utils
import { clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

const mergeClasses = (...inputs) => {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
};

export default mergeClasses;
```

The **second step** is using `cva` from `class-variance-authority` to create the default styling and pass it to the component. The docs will go into further detail but an example is:

```jsx
// utils
import mergeClasses from '@/utils/helpers/mergeClasses'
import {cva} from 'class-variance-authority'

export const baseButtonStyles = cva([
    // base styles here
],{
    // conditional styling here
})

const Button = ({...props, children}) => {
    return (
    <button
        {...props}
        className={mergeClasses(
            baseButtonStyles({
                // cva props here
            })
        )}
    )>
    {children}
    </button>
}

export default Button
```

<CodeBlock>
```jsx
// utils
import { clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

const mergeClasses = (...inputs) => {
return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
};

export default mergeClasses;
```
</CodeBlock>
